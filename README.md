# Computer Vision Nanodegree

## Project: Image Captioning

---

In this notebook, you will learn how to load and pre-process data from the [COCO dataset](http://cocodataset.org/#home). You will also design a CNN-RNN model for automatically generating image captions.

Note that **any amendments that you make to this notebook will not be graded**.  However, you will use the instructions provided in **Step 3** and **Step 4** to implement your own CNN encoder and RNN decoder by making amendments to the **models.py** file provided as part of this project.  Your **models.py** file **will be graded**. 

Feel free to use the links below to navigate the notebook:
- [Step 1](#step1): Explore the Data Loader
- [Step 2](#step2): Use the Data Loader to Obtain Batches
- [Step 3](#step3): Experiment with the CNN Encoder
- [Step 4](#step4): Implement the RNN Decoder
